            <p>My interest in computers and technology stemmed from my childhood obsession of needing to know how everything works. While most kids enjoyed playing with their toys, I disassembled mine so I could understand them. This obsession inevitably led me to computers. Just using a computer wasn’t enough for me. I had to build my own. After coming to the realization that a computer is a little more complicated than my child mind had thought, I got to work researching everything I could, which ultimately led to receiving a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020</p>
            <br>
            <p>Like many engineers, I have a desire to learn and improve the world through technology. I love finding creative ways to solve problems with no clear solution. I am meticulous in everything I do whether it is programming, design, or something else. My ability to quickly learn new skills has allowed me to solve complex problems even when the technologies used are new to me, which has led to a wide range of experience from work with low level hardware to high level programming languages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my first professional role, I worked as a full stack java development and AWS engineering consultant. I had previous development experience using Java, but I saw getting my AWS Associate Developer certification as a challenge and learning opportunity that fit well with my skill set. At this role, I was primarily responsible for developing and deploying spring web applications, configuring and deploying AWS infrastructure, writing Unit Tests and Acceptance Test Driven Development tests, and configuring and deploying managed Jenkins pipelines. This included implementing and testing RESTful API’s, writing code for AWS Lambda functions, and handling AWS Security compliance for a major bank, but the most important thing I learned from this role is that quality matters.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Quality matters. It is one thing to be able to write working code, but to write working code that follows best practices, is user friendly, has no unnecessary complexity, and is designed with future improvements in mind is something completely different. Attention to detail is the difference between code that lasts a lifetime and code that is completely rewritten the next time a change is required. I would rather write code that lasts a lifetime! I attribute much of my career progression to this devotion of quality and desire to learn.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I always look to share my ambition and passion with others. Think I could help solve a problem for you or just want to know more about me? Feel free to reach out and connect!</p>
